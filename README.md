# What You Will Discover

 - In this project, you'll find an in-depth exploration of key areas that are critical for understanding employee performance and improving organizational efficiency. The analysis covers:
   
   - ***1. Highest Average Training Score by Department:*** Identify which department excelled the most in training scores following the company's test.
   - ***2. Variation of Average Age Across Departments:*** Investigate the average age of employees in different departments and understand the age distribution within the organization.
   - ***3. Average Performance Score by Gender:*** Calculate and compare the average performance scores for male and female employees and explore whether there are significant differences between genders.
   - ***4. Correlation Between Tenure and Performance Scores:*** Examine relationship between employees' tenure at the company and their performance scores to uncover any meaningful trends. 

- # What is the ideal solution?

  - I aim to create a dashboard that presents a comprehensive analysis of employee performance data. This dashboard will include insights on the highest average training score by department, the variation of average age across departments, the average performance score by gender and the correlation between tenure and performance scores.

- # Data Source
